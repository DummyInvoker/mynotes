when use jquery method, need to wrap jquery object to target.

fix print repeating header
thead {
        display: table-row-group; 
    }

Restore deleted files:
git rev-list -n 1 HEAD -- <file_path> //relative file path
git checkout <deleting_commit>^ -- <file_path>

To run gulp, first go to gulpfile.js directory

angular ng-repeat can work with indexOf object, don't pass $index to controller because filter can change the $index, instead, pass the object
